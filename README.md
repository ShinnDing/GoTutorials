Go Essential Training from LinkedIn Learning

Video tutorials can be found at https://www.linkedin.com/learning/go-essential-training-16567666/go-for-modern-applications?autoplay=true.

All code is from https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/go-essential-training-2446262.

I used these tutorials and code samples to learn the basics of the Go Language. The code was retyped to build muscle memory.
